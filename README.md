# Hi, I’m Kethaka 👋

I'm a builder, problem solver, and visual thinker based in Sri Lanka. Currently an undergrad at the University of Moratuwa, studying Computer Science & Engineering (specializing in Cybersecurity), but most of what I’ve learned came from **building things I needed — then refining them until they were useful for others too**.
